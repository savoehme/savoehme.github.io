<p>Hey! I'm Sav. I am a graphic design major with a passion for all things creative. Ever since I was a child I was always drawn to anything artsy. My first dream job was a fashion designer but if you could've seen how I dressed you would understand why that didn't work out. Now I mostly find my passion in digital art, design, and photography. If you're intersted in working together please fill out the form below to contact me. Look forward to hearing from you!</p>
